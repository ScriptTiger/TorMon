# TorMon  
Simple Tor controller for those that just want a single simple stand-alone compiled executable rather than needing to go through Python with STEM or other similar overly complex managed scripted projects utilizing countless dependency packages just to open a simple socket connection.

Usage:

TorMon [-host IP] [-port PORT] [-secret PASSWORD] [-cmd COMMAND]

By default, TorMon will connect to 127.0.0.1:9051 and attempt to authenticate to Tor without a password and begin an interactive session.
